Why is my refund process taking so long ?,
How I Refund for my Meal ticket ?,"Unfortunately, refund is not available for in-flight meals. Please also keep in mind that when you cancel or reschedule your flight, your meal will not be added to your new flight and a refund will not be issued for the meal."
Why I cannot submit refund on my flight ?,"There are a number of reasons why your refund cannot be processed by the airline, which are:

Your ticket has been used.
You have used a part of the tickets in your booking, while the airline doesn’t allow partial refund.
You have checked in to your flight.
Your ticket has passed its validity period.


If one of the reasons above apply to you, your ticket, including its add-ons, will no longer be refundable."
What are the airlines that can be refunded?,"Available only on some flights, Traveloka Refund Promise is essentially our promise that your refund will arrive on time, no matter what.

So far, our promise is either in 14 or 30 days. This means that should you request a refund for your flight later on, you will receive your refund at the latest 14 or 30 days after your refund submission day.
